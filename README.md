# isomorphic_detector
Compare two strings and check if they have an isomorphic relationship.

Two strings are isomorphic when: 

1.) Thereâ€™s a one-to-one relationship between their characters. 
2.) The order and frequency of characters are consistent between both strings. 
3.) No two different characters from the first string map to the same character in the second string, and vice versa. 

For example: 'egg' and 'add' are isomorphic because: The 'e' maps to the 'a', the first 'g' maps to 'd', and the second 'g' also maps to 'd'. 

On the other hand:  'foo' and 'bar' are not isomorphic because the two 'o's in 'foo' would need to map to different characters in 'bar', which breaks the pattern.
